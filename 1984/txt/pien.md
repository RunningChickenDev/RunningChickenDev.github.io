<h1>The Great Leap Forward</h1>


Around 1960 in China, a new ruler came to power with his socialistic party: Mao Zedong. He was there is a time of need and stepped in. He spread the word presumibly by hanging posters, we can never be sure for there were little documents made and archived from that periode of time.

98% of the population were farmers. They wanted a better life and that is what was depicted on the posters of Mao's campaign. <img src="img/img1.jpg" align="right"></img>

This positive look on the world could however not become reality. Quite the opposite actually: with the help of Mao's new regime the Chinese population fell into famine. That is why in the second part of his campaign ,Mao depicted himself more than the masses. On the posters he stood front and centre like he was God - their savior.

Other means of communication barely existed. The tv was invented though this hadn't reached China, they didn't have the money. Radios were present though not a main way of mass comunication and no form of direct communication. The radio was also only availible for a very small,richer part of the community.

I think Mao was only availible to seize power because of the dispair the people were in. His win had nothing to do with his awesome advertising or communication.
